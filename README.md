Not Candy Crush, is a Candy Crush clone built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I wanted to brush up on my "plain old JavaScript" knowledge and implement a few new CSS concepts, specifically CSS grid and flex-box. Not Candy Crush features a lot of new concepts for me in both JavaScript and CSS. I used the "draggable" property to move the squares around, and learned about drag start, drag drop and end. CSS grid was a fun challenge, setting the correct column and row properties CSS flex-box for the game board was really interesting as well. Not Candy Crush supports only desktop browser capability at the moment.
